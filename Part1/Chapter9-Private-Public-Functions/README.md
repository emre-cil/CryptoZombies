# Chapter 9: Private / Public Functions

In Solidity, functions are `public` by default. This means anyone (or any other contract) can call your contract's function and execute its code.

Obviously this isn't always desirable, and can make your contract vulnerable to attacks. Thus it's good practice to mark your functions as `private` by default, and then only make `public` the functions you want to expose to the world.

Let's look at how to declare a private function:

```
uint[] numbers;

function _addToArray(uint _number) private {
  numbers.push(_number);
}

```

This means only other functions within our contract will be able to call this function and add to the `numbers` array.

As you can see, we use the keyword `private` after the function name. And as with function parameters, it's convention to start private function names with an underscore (`_`).

# Put it to the test

Our contract's `createZombie` function is currently public by default â€” this means anyone could call it and create a new Zombie in our contract! Let's make it private.

1.  Modify `createZombie` so it's a private function. Don't forget the naming convention!
