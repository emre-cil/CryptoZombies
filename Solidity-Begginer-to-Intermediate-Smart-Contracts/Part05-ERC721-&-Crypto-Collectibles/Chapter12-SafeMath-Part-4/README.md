# Chapter 12: SafeMath Part 4

Great, now we can implement SafeMath on all the types of `uint`s we used in our DApp!

Let's fix all those potential issues in `ZombieAttack`. (There was also one `zombies[_zombieId].level++;` that needed to be fixed in `ZombieHelper`, but we've taken care of that one for you so we don't take an extra chapter to do so ðŸ˜‰).

## Putting it to the Test

Go ahead and implement SafeMath methods on all the `++` increments in `ZombieAttack`. We've left comments in the code to make them easy to find.
